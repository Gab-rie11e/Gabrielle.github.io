            <h1>Cloud Strife<br></h1>
            <p>An ex-SOLDIER: first class, Cloud came to Midgar to start a new chapter of his life as a mercenary.<br>
                At the invitation of his childhood friend, Tifa, he accepted a job with Avalanche. He may bring his<br>
                buster sword to bear against Shinra troopers, but he does not care for plight of the planet.<br>
                For him, this is a job and nothing more.</p>

            <h1>Aerith Gainsborough<br></h1>
            <p>Aerith is a flower seller who lives in the Sector 5 slums, who first meets Cloud on the streets of Midgar<br>
               after the bombing of Mako Reactor 1. Shinra has kept a close eye on her ever since she was a child,<br>
               as she has the ability to hear the voice of the planet. She is often found tending a modest bed of flowers<br>
               at an old church in Sector 5.</p>

            <p>A loyal member of Avalanche─an underground organization opposed to Shinra─Tifa also runs Seventh Heaven,<br>
               a popular bar in the Sector 7 slums. Although she bears a terrible grudge towards Shinra, she is not convinced<br>
               that bombing mako reactors is the solution. As she struggled to reconcile her cause with her conscience,<br>
               Tifa was reunited with her childhood friend, Cloud, for the first time in years...</p>

            <p>A former SOLDIER who distinguished himself as a hero in the war against Wutai. His accomplishments on the battlefield are so legendary<br>
              that they inspired countless people to join the military. Official reports state that he died while on a classified mission,<br>
