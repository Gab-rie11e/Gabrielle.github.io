                <p> Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII serves as a prequel to the original Final Fantasy VII.
                     The story follows Zack Fair, a member of the paramilitary organization SOLDIER, as he uncovers secrets about the corporation Shinra, 
                     its experiments, and the mysterious origins of the powerful warrior Sephiroth. It takes place seven years before the events of "Final Fantasy VII," 
                     providing crucial backstory and context to the main game's plot.</p>

                    Final Fantasy VII Remake follows the story of Cloud Strife, a former member of the elite SOLDIER unit, 
                    who joins the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE to fight against the corporation Shinra, which is draining the planet's life energy, 
                    known as Mako, for profit. As Cloud and his allies, including the passionate rebel leader Barret Wallace and the mysterious Aerith Gainsborough, 
                    undertake missions to thwart Shinra's plans, they become embroiled in a larger conflict involving ancient prophecies, powerful adversaries, 
                    and the enigmatic entity known as Sephiroth.</p>
